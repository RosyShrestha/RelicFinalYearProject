						Our story
					</h3>

					<p class="p-b-28">
						We started off by our own pain. Wanting to gift people close to you things that means something and that they can
						hold onto as something special for them too. So, often times not getting the things that you want to get
						for that particular person becomes the pain. Setteling for less than what we want has pretty much become the
						thing. But gift is supposed to be something that can make you smile, cry, laugh, get angry over or pretty
						much bring the myraids of memories when you look at them even when the time passes by and the gift is only
						thing that reminds you of each other. So what better than the blank canvas where you can print out your
						memoris and thoughts out loud.And specially when ts the thing that was gifted is completely made whith that
						person in mind.Its becomes his or her own that was made with them in mind. This is how we started Wanting
						to create the beautiful memory.So RELIC it is.

							Creativity is just connecting things. When you ask creative people how they did something, they feel a little guilty because they didn't really do it, they just saw something. It seemed obvious to them after a while.
